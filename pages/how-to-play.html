    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>Word Scramble is a fun and exciting game to get us to use our thinking hats! How to play is very simple. You are given a series of words under a certain theme. The "words" letters are placed in the incorrect spots of the word, almost as if they are...SCRAMBLED! It is then your page to interpret these scrambled words, put the letters in the correct position of the word, and ultimately unscramble them. Good Luck : )</p>
